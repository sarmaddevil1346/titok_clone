# TikTok Clone with Firebase

![TikTok Clone]

Welcome to the TikTok Clone with Firebase repository! This Flutter project replicates the popular TikTok app using Firebase services for authentication, real-time data, and cloud storage.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Utilizing `firebase_auth`, users can create accounts, log in, and enjoy a personalized TikTok experience.

- **Real-time Video Feeds**: The app uses `cloud_firestore` to display real-time video feeds, mimicking TikTok's endless scroll of engaging content.

- **Video Uploads**: Users can upload their own videos, which are stored using `firebase_storage`. These videos can then be shared with the TikTok community.

- **Profile Management**: Manage your profile, view your uploaded videos, and engage with the TikTok community.

- **Media Selection**: Employing `image_picker`, users can choose videos from their device's gallery for uploading.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/sarmaddevil1346/titok_clone.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```shell
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Set up Firebase:
   - Create a Firebase project on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Configure your project to use Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and Storage.
   - Download the `google-services.json` file and place it in your Flutter app's `android/app` directory for Android, and the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file for iOS.
   - Your Firebase configuration should be automatically initialized in the project due to `firebase_core`.

4. Run the app:
   ```shell
   flutter run
   ```
